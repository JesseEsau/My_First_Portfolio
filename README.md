# My First Portfolio

This repository contains my completed **My_First_Portfolio** project, part of the **ALX Frontend Web Development program**. The project showcases my understanding of HTML fundamentals through a set of simple, web pages.



## 🚀 Project Description

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with HTML by building static web pages using valid and semantic markup. It demonstrates how to use various HTML elements to organize content, create navigation, display images, and tables etc.



## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, I am now able to:

- ✅ Explain what **HTML** is and how it works.
- ✅ Create my own HTML pages using **valid markup**.
- ✅ Use **tags** and **attributes** correctly to structure content.
- ✅ Understand what a **markup language** is and how it helps browsers render web pages.




## 🔍 Features Demonstrated

- Document structure using `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`
- Headings, paragraphs, links, and lists
- Inserting images with `<img>`
- Navigation using `<a>` tags
- Use of semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`



## 🧠 What I Learned

- The importance of semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO
- Proper usage of elements and attributes to improve readability and maintainability
